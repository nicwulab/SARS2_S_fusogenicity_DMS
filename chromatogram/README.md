## Studying the impact of HR1 mutations on SARS-CoV-2 spike expression and fusion using deep mutational scanning: Chromatogram

### Dependencies
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 4.1)

### Input files
* [./chromatogram.csv](./chromatogram.csv): Absorbance (at 280 nm) values for various soluble spike constructs

### Generating output
* Run the R script to generate plot of absorbance against elution volume for various soluble spike constructs
